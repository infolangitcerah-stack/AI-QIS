# üìú Project Charter (DEFINE Phase)
*Part of the AI Quality Intelligence Suite (AI-QIS) ‚Äî applying DMAIC principles to empower SMEs.*

---

## üß≠ DEFINE PHASE OVERVIEW
The Define phase establishes the foundation of the AI-QIS initiative ‚Äî clarifying *why the project exists*, *what problems it addresses*, and *what outcomes it aims to achieve*.
This document serves as both the **Project Charter** and the **Define deliverable** of the AI-QIS DMAIC cycle.

> ‚ÄúDEFINE sets the direction. MEASURE validates it. ANALYZE explains it. IMPROVE enhances it. CONTROL sustains it.‚Äù

## üí° 1. Project Title
**AI-QIS: Turning Feedback into Actionable Intelligence for SMEs**
An AI-powered ecosystem that integrates Total Quality Management (TQM) and DMAIC principles to transform customer feedback and process data into continuous improvement.

---

## üíº 2. Business Case
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in both manufacturing and services often lack structured tools to translate customer feedback into actionable improvement.
Traditional quality management systems (ISO 9001, IATF 16949) emphasize *measurement, analysis, and improvement*, yet most SMEs rely on manual spreadsheets or ad-hoc practices.

**AI-QIS** provides a bridge between:
- Simplicity (ease of use, SME accessibility)  
- Structure (TQM and Six Sigma discipline)  
- Intelligence (AI reasoning and visualization)

This combination enables SMEs to adopt quality management as a digital practice, not just a certification requirement.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Problem / Opportunity Statement
**Problem:**
SMEs collect valuable customer and operational data but lack the capacity to analyze and act on it quickly. This results in lost insights, delayed corrective actions, and stagnation in quality improvement.

**Opportunity:**
Leverage AI-driven analysis to interpret customer sentiment, process variation, and improvement trends ‚Äî guiding SMEs to make faster, data-informed decisions and improve customer satisfaction systematically.

| Growth | Position SMEs for predictive and self-improving quality systems |

---

## üèÜ 5. Goal Statement
To establish the foundation for an AI-powered TQM ecosystem that enables SMEs to move from reactive quality control to proactive quality intelligence.  
The Define phase aims to:  
- Articulate the business case and problem statement.  
- Establish project goals, scope, and structure.  
- Provide a clear roadmap for the following DMAIC phases.
