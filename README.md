# AI-QIS
🧭 AI-QIS — AI Quality Intelligence Suite

Turning feedback into actionable intelligence for SMEs.

AI-QIS empowers small and medium enterprises to embrace continuous improvement using intelligent, accessible tools.
It transforms customer feedback, operational data, and process insights into meaningful actions — without the complexity of traditional Six Sigma systems.

💡 The Framework

AI-QIS applies a structured improvement logic inspired by world-class quality systems — guiding users through the natural flow of Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control, with an AI layer connecting all stages into a single learning loop.

DEFINE  →  MEASURE  →  ANALYZE  →  IMPROVE  →  CONTROL
