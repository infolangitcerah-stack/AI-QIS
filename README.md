🧭 AI-QIS — AI Quality Intelligence Suite

Turning feedback into actionable intelligence for SMEs.

AI-QIS empowers small and medium enterprises to embrace continuous improvement using intelligent, accessible tools.
It transforms customer feedback, operational data, and process insights into meaningful actions — without the complexity of traditional Six Sigma systems.

💡 The Framework

AI-QIS applies a structured improvement logic inspired by world-class quality systems — guiding users through the natural flow of Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control, with an AI layer connecting all stages into a single learning loop.

DEFINE  →  MEASURE  →  ANALYZE  →  IMPROVE  →  CONTROL
   ↓                                          ↑
         AI-INSIGHT LAYER (Continuous Learning)

⚙️ Prototype Tools (Phase 1)
Stage	Tool Name	Purpose	AI Output Example
🧭 Define	AI-NPS Analyzer	Capture customer sentiment and Net Promoter Score	“Top 3 themes: waiting time, friendliness, cleanliness”
⏱️ Measure	Cycle Time Tracker	Record and visualize process or service lead time	Histogram + average time trend
🧠 Analyze	AI-5 Whys / RCA Assistant	Identify root causes using guided AI reasoning	“Root cause: unclear work instruction”
🔄 Improve	Action Tracker (CPM Mini)	Log corrective/preventive actions and monitor progress	Before/After comparison chart
🧹 Control	5S Self-Audit Tool	Sustain discipline and visual housekeeping	5S trend scorecard
